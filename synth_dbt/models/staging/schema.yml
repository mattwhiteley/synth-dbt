      Pageview data from test seed CSV. 1748 Non-null duplicate rows found
      ## Known state from sources:
      ### pagesviews.csv:
        - user_id: 10639 with NULL ids. 12615 rows with malformed GUIDs. Quarantined and tested in staging.
        - name: <10 rows with obvious malformed paths incl. '/sin-in', '/MY.ACOOUN', '/vidmeos'. These rows are preserved in staging: If we can track a user has visited the site, then they are in someway active and at this high-level we should not be excluding this as activity. 
        In adding extra levels of detail as we dive into the data, we would need take a position on how we resolve these malformed paths
        - Duplicate Rows: 1748 rows found with duplicate ID, Timestamp and Name. Deduped in staging, quarantined, and tested.
